  "description": "WinoGrande: An Adversarial Winograd Schema Challenge at Scale. A large-scale dataset of 44,000 pronoun resolution problems designed to test machine commonsense reasoning. Uses adversarial filtering to reduce spurious biases and provides a more robust evaluation of whether AI systems truly understand commonsense or exploit statistical shortcuts. Current best AI methods achieve 59.4-79.1% accuracy, significantly below human performance of 94.0%.",
