  "description": "A comprehensive benchmark that evaluates large language models' ability to solve complex, practical programming tasks via code generation. Contains 1,140 fine-grained tasks across 7 domains using function calls from 139 libraries. Challenges LLMs to invoke multiple function calls as tools and handle complex instructions for realistic software engineering and general-purpose reasoning tasks.",
