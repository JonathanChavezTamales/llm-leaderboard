  "description": "CruxEval-O is the output prediction task of the CRUXEval benchmark, designed to evaluate code reasoning, understanding, and execution capabilities. It consists of 800 Python functions (3-13 lines) where models must predict the output given a function and input. The benchmark tests fundamental code execution reasoning abilities and goes beyond simple code generation to assess deeper understanding of program behavior.",
