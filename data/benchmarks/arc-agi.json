  "description": "The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a benchmark designed to test general intelligence and abstract reasoning capabilities through visual grid-based transformation tasks. Each task consists of 2-5 demonstration pairs showing input grids transformed into output grids according to underlying rules, with test-takers required to infer these rules and apply them to novel test inputs. The benchmark uses colored grids (up to 30x30) with 10 discrete colors/symbols, designed to measure human-like general fluid intelligence and skill-acquisition efficiency with minimal prior knowledge.",
