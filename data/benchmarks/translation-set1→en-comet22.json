  "description": "COMET-22 is a neural machine translation evaluation metric that uses an ensemble of two models: a COMET estimator trained with Direct Assessments and a multitask model that predicts sentence-level scores and word-level OK/BAD tags. It provides improved correlations with human judgments and increased robustness to critical errors compared to previous metrics.",
