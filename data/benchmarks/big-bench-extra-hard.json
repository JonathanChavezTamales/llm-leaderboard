  "description": "BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) is a challenging benchmark that replaces each task in BIG-Bench Hard with a novel task that probes similar reasoning capabilities but exhibits significantly increased difficulty. The benchmark contains 23 tasks testing diverse reasoning skills including many-hop reasoning, causal understanding, spatial reasoning, temporal arithmetic, geometric reasoning, linguistic reasoning, logic puzzles, and humor understanding. Designed to address saturation on existing benchmarks where state-of-the-art models achieve near-perfect scores, BBEH shows substantial room for improvement with best models achieving only 9.8-44.8% average accuracy.",
