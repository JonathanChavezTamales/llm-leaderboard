  "description": "The Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) is the first comprehensive and executable function call evaluation dedicated to assessing Large Language Models' ability to invoke functions. It evaluates serial and parallel function calls across multiple programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, REST API) using a novel Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) evaluation method. The benchmark consists of over 2,000 question-function-answer pairs covering diverse application domains and complex use cases including multiple function calls, parallel function calls, and multi-turn interactions.",
