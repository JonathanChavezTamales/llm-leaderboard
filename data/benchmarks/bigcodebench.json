  "description": "A benchmark that challenges LLMs to invoke multiple function calls as tools from 139 libraries and 7 domains for 1,140 fine-grained programming tasks. Evaluates code generation with diverse function calls and complex instructions, featuring two variants: Complete (code completion based on comprehensive docstrings) and Instruct (generating code from natural language instructions).",
