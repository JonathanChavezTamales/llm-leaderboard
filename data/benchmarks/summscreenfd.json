  "description": "SummScreenFD is the ForeverDreaming subset of the SummScreen dataset for abstractive screenplay summarization, comprising pairs of TV series transcripts and human-written recaps from 88 different shows. The dataset provides a challenging testbed for abstractive summarization where plot details are often expressed indirectly in character dialogues and scattered across the entirety of the transcript, requiring models to find and integrate these details to form succinct plot descriptions.",
