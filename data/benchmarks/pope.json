  "description": "Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation (POPE) is a benchmark for evaluating object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). POPE addresses the problem where LVLMs generate objects inconsistent with target images by using a polling-based query method that asks yes/no questions about object presence in images, providing more stable and flexible evaluation of object hallucination.",
