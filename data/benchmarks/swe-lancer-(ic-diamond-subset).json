  "description": "SWE-Lancer (IC-Diamond subset) is a benchmark of real-world freelance software engineering tasks from Upwork, ranging from $50 bug fixes to $32,000 feature implementations. It evaluates AI models on independent engineering tasks using end-to-end tests triple-verified by experienced software engineers, and includes managerial tasks where models choose between technical implementation proposals.",
