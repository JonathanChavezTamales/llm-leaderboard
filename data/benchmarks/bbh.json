  "description": "Big-Bench Hard (BBH) is a suite of 23 challenging tasks selected from BIG-Bench for which prior language model evaluations did not outperform the average human-rater. These tasks require multi-step reasoning across diverse domains including arithmetic, logical reasoning, reading comprehension, and commonsense reasoning. The benchmark was designed to test capabilities believed to be beyond current language models and focuses on evaluating complex reasoning skills including temporal understanding, spatial reasoning, causal understanding, and deductive logical reasoning.",
