  "description": "A novel multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate large language models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. Comprises 1,142 question-answer pairs covering 8 task categories from basic perception to complex inference, with a unique constraint that accurate responses require integrated understanding of all three modalities.",
