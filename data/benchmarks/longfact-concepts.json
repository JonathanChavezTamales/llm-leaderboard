  "description": "LongFact is a benchmark for evaluating long-form factuality in large language models. It comprises 2,280 fact-seeking prompts spanning 38 topics, designed to test a model's ability to generate accurate, long-form responses. The benchmark uses SAFE (Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator) to evaluate factual accuracy.",
