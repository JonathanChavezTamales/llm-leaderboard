  "description": "BrowseComp is a benchmark comprising 1,266 questions that challenge AI agents to persistently navigate the internet in search of hard-to-find, entangled information. The benchmark measures agents' ability to exercise persistence in information gathering, demonstrate creativity in web navigation, and find concise, verifiable answers. Despite the difficulty of the questions, BrowseComp is simple and easy-to-use, as predicted answers are short and easily verifiable against reference answers.",
