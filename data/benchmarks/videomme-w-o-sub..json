  "description": "Video-MME is a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for multi-modal large language models in video analysis. It features 900 videos across 6 primary visual domains with 30 subfields, ranging from 11 seconds to 1 hour in duration, with 2,700 question-answer pairs. The benchmark evaluates MLLMs' capabilities in processing sequential visual data and multi-modal content including video frames, subtitles, and audio.",
