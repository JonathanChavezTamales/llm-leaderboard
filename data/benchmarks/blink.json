  "description": "BLINK: Multimodal Large Language Models Can See but Not Perceive. A benchmark for multimodal language models focusing on core visual perception abilities. Reformats 14 classic computer vision tasks into 3,807 multiple-choice questions paired with single or multiple images and visual prompting. Tasks include relative depth estimation, visual correspondence, forensics detection, multi-view reasoning, counting, object localization, and spatial reasoning that humans can solve 'within a blink'.",
