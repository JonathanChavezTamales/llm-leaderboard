  "description": "SQuALITY (Summarization-format QUestion Answering with Long Input Texts, Yes!) is a long-document summarization dataset built by hiring highly-qualified contractors to read public-domain short stories (3000-6000 words) and write original summaries from scratch. Each document has five summaries: one overview and four question-focused summaries. Designed to address limitations in existing summarization datasets by providing high-quality, faithful summaries.",
