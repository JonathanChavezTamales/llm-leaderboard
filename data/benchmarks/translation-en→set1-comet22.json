  "description": "COMET-22 is an ensemble machine translation evaluation metric combining a COMET estimator model trained with Direct Assessments and a multitask model that predicts sentence-level scores and word-level OK/BAD tags. It demonstrates improved correlations compared to state-of-the-art metrics and increased robustness to critical errors.",
