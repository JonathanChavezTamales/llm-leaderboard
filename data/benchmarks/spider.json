  "description": "A large-scale, complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL dataset annotated by 11 college students. Contains 10,181 questions and 5,693 unique complex SQL queries on 200 databases with multiple tables, covering 138 different domains. Requires models to generalize to both new SQL queries and new database schemas, making it distinct from previous semantic parsing tasks that use single databases.",
