  "description": "A comprehensive multi-modal video understanding benchmark covering 20 challenging video tasks that require temporal understanding beyond single-frame analysis. Tasks span from perception to cognition, including action recognition, temporal reasoning, spatial reasoning, object interaction, scene transition, and counterfactual inference. Uses a novel static-to-dynamic method to systematically generate video tasks from existing annotations.",
