  "description": "BrowseComp is a benchmark for measuring the ability of agents to browse the web, comprising 1,266 questions that require persistently navigating the internet in search of hard-to-find, entangled information. Despite the difficulty of the questions, BrowseComp is simple and easy-to-use, as predicted answers are short and easily verifiable against reference answers. The benchmark focuses on questions where answers are obscure, time-invariant, and well-supported by evidence scattered across the open web.",
