  "description": "LiveBench is a challenging, contamination-limited LLM benchmark that addresses test set contamination by releasing new questions monthly based on recently-released datasets, arXiv papers, news articles, and IMDb movie synopses. It comprises tasks across math, coding, reasoning, language, instruction following, and data analysis with verifiable, objective ground-truth answers.",
