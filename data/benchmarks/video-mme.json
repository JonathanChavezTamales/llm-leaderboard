  "description": "Video-MME is the first-ever comprehensive evaluation benchmark of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in video analysis. It features 900 videos totaling 254 hours with 2,700 human-annotated question-answer pairs across 6 primary visual domains (Knowledge, Film & Television, Sports Competition, Life Record, Multilingual, and others) and 30 subfields. The benchmark evaluates models across diverse temporal dimensions (11 seconds to 1 hour), integrates multi-modal inputs including video frames, subtitles, and audio, and uses rigorous manual labeling by expert annotators for precise assessment.",
