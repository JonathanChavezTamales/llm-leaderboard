  "description": "ScreenSpot-Pro is a novel GUI grounding benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the grounding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in professional high-resolution computing environments. The benchmark comprises 1,581 instructions across 23 applications spanning 5 industries and 3 operating systems, featuring authentic high-resolution images from professional domains with expert annotations. Unlike previous benchmarks that focus on cropped screenshots in consumer applications, ScreenSpot-Pro addresses the complexity and diversity of real-world professional software scenarios, revealing significant performance gaps in current MLLM GUI perception capabilities.",
