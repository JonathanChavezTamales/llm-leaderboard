  "description": "MultiChallenge is a realistic multi-turn conversation evaluation benchmark that challenges frontier LLMs across four key categories: instruction retention (maintaining instructions throughout conversations), inference memory (recalling and connecting details from previous turns), reliable versioned editing (adapting to evolving instructions during collaborative editing), and self-coherence (avoiding contradictions in responses). The benchmark evaluates models on sustained, contextually complex dialogues across diverse topics including travel planning, technical documentation, and professional communication.",
