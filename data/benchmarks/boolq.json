  "description": "BoolQ is a reading comprehension dataset for yes/no questions containing 15,942 naturally occurring examples. Each example consists of a question, passage, and boolean answer, where questions are generated in unprompted and unconstrained settings. The dataset challenges models with complex, non-factoid information requiring entailment-like inference to solve.",
