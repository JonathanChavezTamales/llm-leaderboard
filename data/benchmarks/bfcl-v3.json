  "description": "Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard v3 (BFCL-v3) is an advanced benchmark that evaluates large language models' function calling capabilities through multi-turn and multi-step interactions. It introduces extended conversational exchanges where models must retain contextual information across turns and execute multiple internal function calls for complex user requests. The benchmark includes 1000 test cases across domains like vehicle control, trading bots, travel booking, and file system management, using state-based evaluation to verify both system state changes and execution path correctness.",
