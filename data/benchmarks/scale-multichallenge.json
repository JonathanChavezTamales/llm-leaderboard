  "description": "MultiChallenge is a realistic multi-turn conversation evaluation benchmark developed by Scale AI that evaluates large language models on four challenging conversation categories: instruction retention, inference memory of user information, reliable versioned editing, and self-coherence. Each challenge requires accurate instruction-following, context allocation, and in-context reasoning. Despite achieving near-perfect scores on existing multi-turn evaluation benchmarks, all frontier models have less than 50% accuracy on MultiChallenge.",
