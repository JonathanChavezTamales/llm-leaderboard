  "description": "SuperGLUE is a new benchmark styled after GLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, improved resources, and a new public leaderboard. It includes 8 primary tasks: BoolQ (Boolean Questions), CB (CommitmentBank), COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives), MultiRC (Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension), ReCoRD (Reading Comprehension with Commonsense Reasoning), RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment), WiC (Word-in-Context), and WSC (Winograd Schema Challenge). The benchmark evaluates diverse language understanding capabilities including reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, causal reasoning, coreference resolution, textual entailment, and word sense disambiguation across multiple domains.",
