  "description": "RepoBench is a benchmark for evaluating repository-level code auto-completion systems through three interconnected tasks: RepoBench-R (retrieval of relevant code snippets across files), RepoBench-C (code completion with cross-file and in-file context), and RepoBench-P (pipeline combining retrieval and prediction). Supports Python and Java programming languages and addresses the gap in evaluating real-world, multi-file programming scenarios by providing a more complete comparison of performance in auto-completion systems.",
