  "description": "Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) v2 is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models' function calling capabilities. It features 2,251 question-function-answer pairs with enterprise and OSS-contributed functions, addressing data contamination and bias through live, user-contributed scenarios. The benchmark evaluates AST accuracy, executable accuracy, irrelevance detection, and relevance detection across multiple programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript) and includes complex real-world function calling scenarios with multi-lingual prompts.",
