  "description": "A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding. Provides samples from 203 activity classes with an average of 137 untrimmed videos per class and 1.41 activity instances per video, for a total of 849 video hours. The benchmark covers a wide range of complex human activities that are of interest to people in their daily living and can be used to compare algorithms for three scenarios: untrimmed video classification, trimmed activity classification, and activity detection.",
