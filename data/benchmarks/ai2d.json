  "description": "AI2D is a dataset of 4,903 illustrative diagrams from grade school natural sciences (such as food webs, human physiology, and life cycles) with over 15,000 multiple choice questions and answers. The benchmark evaluates diagram understanding and visual reasoning capabilities, requiring models to interpret diagrammatic elements, relationships, and structure to answer questions about scientific concepts represented in visual form.",
