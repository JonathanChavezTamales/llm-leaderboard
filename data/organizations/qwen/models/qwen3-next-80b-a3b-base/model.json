  "description": "Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Base is the foundation model in the Qwen3-Next series, featuring revolutionary architectural innovations for ultimate training and inference efficiency. It introduces Hybrid Attention combining Gated DeltaNet (75% layers) and Gated Attention (25% layers) for efficient ultra-long context modeling, Ultra-Sparse MoE with 512 total experts but only 10 routed + 1 shared expert activated (3.7% activation ratio), and native Multi-Token Prediction for faster inference. With 80B total parameters and only ~3B activated per inference step, it achieves performance comparable to Qwen3-32B while using less than 10% training cost and delivering 10x+ throughput for 32K+ contexts. Trained on 15T tokens with training-stability-friendly designs including Zero-Centered RMSNorm and normalized MoE router parameters. Supports 256K context length, extensible to 1M tokens with YaRN scaling.",
