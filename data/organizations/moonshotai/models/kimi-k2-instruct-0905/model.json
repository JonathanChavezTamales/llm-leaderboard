  "description": "Kimi K2-Instruct-0905 is the latest, most capable version of Kimi K2, achieving state-of-the-art performance in frontier knowledge, math, and coding among non-thinking models. This Mixture-of-Experts model features 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters, meticulously optimized for agentic tasks. Key features include enhanced agentic coding intelligence, extended context length to 256K tokens, and a hybrid architecture trained with MuonClip optimizer on 15.5T tokens. The model achieves 65.8% on SWE-bench Verified (single attempt), 47.3% on SWE-bench Multilingual, and excels at tool use with 70.6% on Tau2-retail. It is a reflex-grade model without long thinking, designed to act and execute complex tasks seamlessly.",
