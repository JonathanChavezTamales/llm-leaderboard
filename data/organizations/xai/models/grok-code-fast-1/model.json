  "description": "Grok Code Fast 1 is a speedy and economical reasoning model that excels at agentic coding. Built from scratch with a brand-new model architecture, it features a pre-training corpus rich with programming-related content and post-training datasets that reflect real-world pull requests and coding tasks. The model has mastered the use of common tools like grep, terminal, and file editing, making it ideal for integration with IDEs. It is exceptionally versatile across the full software development stack and is particularly adept at TypeScript, Python, Java, Rust, C++, and Go.",
