  "description": "GLM-4.5 is an Agentic, Reasoning, and Coding (ARC) foundation model designed for intelligent agents, featuring 355 billion total parameters with 32 billion active parameters using MoE architecture. Trained on 23T tokens through multi-stage training, it is a hybrid reasoning model that provides two modes: thinking mode for complex reasoning and tool usage, and non-thinking mode for immediate responses. The model unifies agentic, reasoning, and coding capabilities with 128K context length support. It achieves exceptional performance with a score of 63.2 across 12 industry-standard benchmarks, placing 3rd among all proprietary and open-source models. Released under MIT open-source license allowing commercial use and secondary development.",
